## Description
This is a set of scripts, tips, tricks and snippets for various tasks performed on MikroTik routers. Some of the scripts and their usage is well described in articles on https://www.dasm.cz/tag/mikrotik (written in Czech). Use them at your own risk as there is often some context or additional configuration needed.

### 6to4
Snippets for 6to4 tunneling setup on IPv4 networks with public IP terminated on MikroTik.

### Automatic upgrade
Automatic upgrade of RouterOS with mail notification. Be really careful with this one as it already happened several times that MikroTik guys made the packages incompatible between versions.

### Backup
Automatic backup over mail. Sends both RSC script and a encrypted backup file.

### Firewall
Filtering incoming and outgoing IPv4 traffic. Lots of ports in outgoing rules allow to collect nice traffic statistics.

### Malware
Additional filtering for malware IPs obtained from publicly available blacklists.

### MTU
Just a small mangle script for smooth packet forwarding between networks with different MTU lengths.

### Restrict country
Filtering based on country IP blocks.

### SSTP Let's Encrypt
Core scripts for SSTP server using Let's Encrypt certificates. Much more configuration needed as described on https://www.dasm.cz/clanek/mikrotik-sstp-server-s-let-s-encrypt-certifikatem

### Tor / Torrent
Filtering of Tor nodes based on their type and Torrent services, including bootstraps and DHT.
